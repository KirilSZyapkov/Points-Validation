# Points-Validation
Points Validation

JS program that receives two points in the format [x1, y1, x2, y2] and checks if the distances between each point and the start of the cartesian coordinate system (0, 0) and between the points themselves is valid. A distance between two points is considered valid, if it is an integer value. In case a distance is valid write "{x1, y1} to {x2, y2} is valid", in case the distance is invalid write "{x1, y1} to {x2, y2} is invalid".
